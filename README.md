# Spring-Boot-Microservices

## Summary
In this project, I used the Spring Boot Framework to create two microservices; one for drivers and the other for car insurance.
Each driver has a set of attrubites that defines them and is stored within a MySQL database. Each insurance associated with a driver has its own attributes that are stored within a MongoDB database. 

Using a eurka server, I was able to display all the microservices in location. Lastly, both microservices were able to communicate with each other and able to take a request from the UI and send a response back.
